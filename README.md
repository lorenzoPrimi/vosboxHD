**Listen to your music collection on-the-go with the vosbox iPad app!**

Vosbox is is a HTML5 PHP/jQuery based jukebox developed by my friend [Callan Bryant](http://callanbryant.co.uk)

The iOS app was developed based on [vosbox API](https://github.com/naggie/vosbox) in 2012.

This iPad app is a fork of the iPhone app with a totally new design for an improved user experience.

**This project is now totally open source.**
